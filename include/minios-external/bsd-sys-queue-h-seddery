 * DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE
 *
 * Generated automatically by bsd-sys-queue-h-seddery to
 *  - introduce ${ucnamespace}_ and ${namespace}_ namespace prefixes
 *  - turn "struct type" into "type" so that type arguments
 *     to the macros are type names not struct tags
 *  - remove the reference to sys/cdefs.h, which is not needed
 *
 * The purpose of this seddery is to allow the resulting file to be
 * freely included by software which might also want to include other
 * list macros; to make it usable when struct tags are not being used
 * or not known; to make it more portable.
